## Key Concepts & Terms

### ITUR

- **ITUR**: A continuous value representing the level of urbanization for a given region or cell. The target variable for prediction.

### Sentinel-2 Bands

- **Sentinel-2**: A European Space Agency satellite providing multispectral images.
- **Bands**: 13 spectral bands (B01–B12, B8A) covering visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared wavelengths. Each band captures different information about the Earth's surface.

### Spectral Indices

- **Spectral Index**: A mathematical combination of two or more bands to highlight specific surface features (e.g., vegetation, water, built-up areas).
- **Common Indices Used**:
  - **NDVI**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (vegetation health)
  - **NDBI**: Normalized Difference Built-up Index (urban/built-up areas)
  - **SAVI**: Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
  - **MSAVI**: Modified SAVI
  - **NDWI**: Normalized Difference Water Index
  - **NMDI**: Normalized Multi-band Drought Index
  - **NBR**: Normalized Burn Ratio
- **spyndex**: Python library used to compute these indices from band data.

### Custom Channels

- **Custom Channels**: The set of bands and/or indices used as input features for the model. You can specify any combination to optimize model performance.

### Pretrained Weights

- **Pretrained Weights**: Model parameters learned from large datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Sentinel-2) and used to initialize the model for faster convergence and better performance.
- **TorchGeo/torchvision**: Libraries providing pretrained models for remote sensing and general vision tasks.

### Early Stopping

- **Early Stopping**: A training strategy that halts training when validation performance stops improving, preventing overfitting and saving compute time. The best model weights are restored automatically.
- **Patience**: Number of epochs to wait for improvement before stopping.
- **Minimum Delta**: Minimum change to qualify as an improvement.

### Data Augmentation

- **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations (e.g., flips, rotations, noise) applied to training images to improve model generalization and robustness.
- **albumentations**: Library used for fast, flexible image augmentation.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared difference between predictions and true values. Penalizes large errors more.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference between predictions and true values. Easier to interpret, less sensitive to outliers.
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures how well predictions explain the variance in the data. 1.0 = perfect, 0.0 = predicts mean, <0.0 = worse than mean.

### Data Splits

- **Train/Validation/Test**: Standard practice to split data into training (fit model), validation (tune/stop model), and test (final evaluation) sets. Pre-matched CSVs are recommended for large datasets. My split included 50, 20, 30 for train, validate, and test respectively.

### Model Adaptation

- **Input Layer Adaptation**: The model's first convolutional layer is automatically adjusted to accept the number of input channels specified by your custom channels.

### Robust Error Handling

- The pipeline includes checks and warnings for missing files, mismatched channels, non-finite values, and other common issues.
